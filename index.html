    <h1>Who am I?</h1>

    <p>Hi!  My name is Mark.  I was born, raised and still live in Kansas City, MO. I have traveled a lot both personally and professionally.  I have had two jobs in my life that involve travel domestically and internationally.  I have enjoyed seeing other places but like being home the best.
        I enjoy cooking, gardening, playing games 
        and playing with the dogs.

<h1>Water Garden</h1>
<p>I used to have a water garden at my previous house and really missed the serenity that comes with working on it.  My church had one that I had cleaned up and got back running again and chose to redo it </p>

<br>

<p>This is only a small snipet of things from my past.  I am currently in school learning to program with Java Script and Ruby on Rails. Who knows where this new path will take.  I have learned that it is not the destination but the journey that must be enjoyed!! </p>
